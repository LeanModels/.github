# LeanModels â€” Making Foundation Models Leaner and Meaner

Welcome to **LeanModels**, an organization founded by [Tianyi Zhang](https://tonyzhang617.github.io/) dedicated to making foundation models, such as LLMs and diffusion models, more memory- and compute-efficient through practical compression and inference optimization techniques.

Explore our key projects:

* [**DFloat11**](https://github.com/LeanModels/DFloat11): A lossless LLM compression framework enabling efficient GPU inference
* [**Bagel-DFloat11**](https://github.com/LeanModels/Bagel-DFloat11): DFloat11-compressed version of Bagel, a unified multimodal model
* [**LeanQuant**](https://github.com/LeanModels/LeanQuant): Scalable, loss-error-aware quantization for LLMs

We welcome contributors, collaborators, and feedback! If you're working on model compression or efficient inference, feel free to reach out.
